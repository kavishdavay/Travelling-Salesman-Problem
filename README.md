<font color="blue"><h2>Overview</h2></font>
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) involves visiting a cluster of cities once and returning 
to the starting city in the shortest possible distance. The number of possible paths increases 
exponentially as the number of cities increases and there is currently no algorithm that can 
solve it in polynomial-time, making it an NP-hard problem.

Genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that is based on the process biological 
evolution. An initial population of random chromosomes go through a process of evaluation, 
reproduction and mutation to produce a new population of improved chromosomes. The 
concept of natural selection is applied whereby only chromosomes with the highest fitness 
scores get to reproduce. 

Since it is impossible to solve the TSP in polynomial time
a variation of the Genetic Algorithm including a 2-Opt Optimiser has been developed,
providing an approximation of the best possible solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
